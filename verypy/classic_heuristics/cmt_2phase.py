""" This file is a part of the VeRyPy classical vehicle routing problem
heuristic library and provides an implementation of the Christofides, Mingozzi

The script is callable and can be used as a standalone solver for TSPLIB 
formatted CVRPs. It has moderate dependencies: a TSP solver, 
and numpy and scipy for reading and preparing the problem instance."""

    """ Implementation of the Christofides, Mingozzi & Toth (1979) two phase
    heuristic. In the first phase a customer is selected to act as a seed node 
    and initialize a route. Then, a savings criteria parametrized with
    lambda_multiplier is used to determine which customers to insert.
    Insertions are done until a constraint is violated and then a new seed is
    selected and the insertions continue. This is repeated until no unrouted
    customers remain or we run out of route seeds. Finally, the routes are made
    r-optimal with 3-opt. 
    
    The seed customers are carried over the the second phase of the algorithm.
    Here, each customer is associated to a seed customer based on a second 
    savings criteria parametrized with mu_multiplier. Also the next closest 
    seed customer has an effect to the score used when associating the nodes.
    Then, a route is built around each seed customer with the nodes associated
    to that route taking care not to violate feasibility of the route. Finally,
    if a feasible solution was generated, the routes from the second phase 
    are made r-optimal with 3-opt. 
    
    A better of the solutions from the first and second phases is selected 
    and returned.
    
    Note that the default parameters are for a deterministic variant of the 
    stochastic algorithm described in (Christofides et al 1979).
    
    Basic parameters:
    * D is a numpy ndarray (or equvalent) of the full 2D distance matrix.
    * d is a list of demands. d[0] should be 0.0 as it is the depot.
    * C is the capacity constraint limit for the identical vehicles.
    * L is the optional constraint for the maximum route cost/length/duration.
    
    Objective parameter:  
    * minimize_K sets the primary optimization objective. If set to True, it is
       the minimum number of routes and the current best is always replaced
       with a solution with smaller K. If set to False (default) the algorithm 
       optimizes only for the mimimum solution/routing cost. 
    
    Route shape parameters:
    * lambda_multiplier   specifies how closely the customer is associated to 
                           the emerging route seed customer in the first phase.
    * mu_multiplier       specifies how closely the customer is associated to
                           route seed customers in the second phase.

    The implementation includes some improvements to the CMT (1979) algorithm
    to improve the chance of second phase producing feasible solutions:
        
    * phase1_seed_selection_method
                          instead of selecting a seed customer for emerging 
                           route at random in the first phase, select the 
                           "farthest" or "closest" to the depot or the one with 
                           the "biggest" demand. Can also be "first", which 
                           will be random if randomized_retries is set.
                           
    * phase2_choose_most_associated_route   
                           instead of building the routes in random order in 
                           phase 2, start from the route with most associated
                           customers. If set to False implements the original
                           behaviour of (CMT 1979).
    
    * phase2_repeated_association_with_n_routes           
                           if set to None, the original behaviour of (CMT 1979)
                           is used. That is, terminate phase 2 without an
                           feasible solution if the first route building pass
                           over the route seed customers leaves unrouted
                           customers when S=0. If this is set to 1, the
                           procedure is repeated until a) all customers are
                           routed or b) no feasible insertions can be made.
                           If this parameter is set to be >1, also insertion of
                           2. best alternatives to associate with a seed
                           customers are tried. Can also be "K". Then the
                           number of routes generated in the first phase is
                           used as the value of this parameter.
    * number_of_randomized_retries  
                           If None the algorithm is deterministic. If set to an 
                           integer value. The first phase can generate this 
                           many seed customer configurations to second phase 
                           in case second phase is unable to produce feasible
                           solutions.
