""" This file is a part of the VeRyPy classical vehicle routing problem
heuristic library and provides an implementation of the Foster and Ryan (1976)
Petal algorithm. A set of candidate routes are generated using the Sweep
procedure of sweep.py and the CVRP is solved as set covering problem.

The script is callable and can be used as a standalone solver for TSPLIB
formatted CVRPs. It has extensive dependencies: MIP solver Gurobi, Sweep 
procedure of sweep.py, a TSP solver (the built in local search solver can be
used), and numpy and scipy for reading and preparing the problem instance."""

# These define how the 'auto' setting for discard limit works. Basically if 
#  the longest route is more than the number of customers of the first number, 
#  remove at most as many customers as the second number indicates.
# The limits must be in monotonically increasing order. If the route length is
#  under every length limit the number of removed customers is not limited. 
# (see petal_init for details)

# Usually all petals are used in the final pass. However, for large problems
#  the number of petals may become excessively large. This is the magic number

#  use EXTENDED set as long as the total petal count stays under this number.

    """ An implementation of Foster and Ryan (1976) Petal algorithm. The VRP
    is solved with a set covering formulation (SCP->MIP/LP). The decision 
    variables are feasible routes (petals) R_i. The three initial petal sets
    (RESTRICTED, REDUCED, and EXTENDED) are generated with a Sweep algorithm
    the RELAXED petal set is grown when improving local search moves are found.
    
    The algorithm solves SCP iteratively and the petal set size is increased
    when no improvements are found or other conditions are not fulfilled:
        RESTRICTED+RELAXED ->
        REDUCED+RESTRICTED+RELAXED ->
        EXTENDED+REDUCED+RESTRICTED+RELAXED
    
    The implementation uses Gurobi to solve the SCP. 
    
    The RESTRICTED set contains routes each with total demand:
        d_R_i > restricted_route_ratio*C
    
    The REDUCED set contains routes not in RESTRICTED but with total demand:
        d_R_i > C_l
        C_l = sum_{j}{d_j}-(K-1)C
        
    The EXTENDED set contains the ones that have not high enough total demand
    to be included in RESTRICTED or REDUCED sets. By default, the algorithm 
    terminates as soon as no improving solutions can be found, even with
    increasing the petal set size (RESTRICTED->REDUCED->EXTENDED) or loosening
    the K constraint.
    
    Args:
    * points is a list (or 2D numpy ndarray) of coordinate points.
    * D is a numpy ndarray (or equvalent) of the full 2D distance matrix.
    * d is a list of demands. d[0] should be 0.0 as it is the depot.
    * C is the capacity constraint limit for the identical vehicles.
    * L is the optional constraint for the maximum route length/duration/cost.

    * K can be set to require a predefined number of vehicles. However, this 
       constraint is loosened if no feasible solutions are found. If minimize_K 
       is set to True and K is None, a minimum K is found by starting from sm-
       allest possible K and increasing it until a feasible solution is found.
       Else, if K set manually, it is respected (and minimize_K has no effect).
    * minimize_K sets the primary optimization objective. If set to True, it is
       the minimum number of routes. If set to False (default) the algorithm 
       optimizes for the mimimum solution/routing cost. In practice disables
       automatic K constraint.
    
    * relaxe_SCP_solutions turns on the improvement heuristic that is similar 
       to Pair (the chain) heuristic of Wren & Holliday (1972). These improved
       routes are stored to the RELAXED petal set.
    * required_iterations can be used force the Petal algorithm to run a preset 
       number of iterations, with each  exploring one valid SCP solution. If
       this is set to -1 (default) the algorithm terminates after no SCP
       improvements seem to be possible. required_iterations can change this
       by allowing new RELAXED petals to be generated from worse SCP solutions.
       If set to None (default) the feature is disabled.
    * min_iterations works similarly to required_iterations, but it only
       specifies a lower bound for the number of iterations. The rule based
       termination can still decide to continue the search after min_iterations
       has been tried. If set to None (default) the feature is disabled.
    * can_discard_multiple_customers when building relaxed petals, one can 
       set how many customers can be redistributed. This is needed when the 
       route length grows, and the number of combinations becomes too large.
       The value can  be set to:
         False = discard at most 1
         True = discard as many as necessary
         <int> = discard at most this many
         'auto' = the number of maximum discarded customers depend on the
                  length of the route as specified by AUTO_DISCARD_LIMITS
                  e.g. at most 5 for routes with more than 10 customers, 
                       at most 3 for routes with more than 20 customers, 
                       at most 2 for routes with more than 30 customers, 
                       at most 1 for routes with more than 50 customers,
