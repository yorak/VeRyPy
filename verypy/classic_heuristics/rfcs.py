""" This file is a part of the VeRyPy classical vehicle routing problem
heuristic library and provides an implementation of the route-first, cluster-
second heuristic of Newton Thomas (1969) and Beasley (1983).

The script is callable and can be used as a standalone solver for TSPLIB
formatted CVRPs. It has moderate dependencies: a TSP solver. LKH and the built-
in local search solvers are used, but if needed, only the built-in solver will
suffice just fine. Furhtermore, numpy and scipy for reading and preparing the 
problem instance."""

    symmetric CVRPs. The idea has been presented e.g. in Beasley (1983).
    However this implementation is deterministic and does not rely on
    generating several random giant tours.
    
    The algorithm works as follows. First, a the problem is solved as a TSP.
    Then the giant tour TSP solution is partitioned into paths of consecutive
    nodes that satisfy problem constraints e.g. the capacity constraint. From
    the all valid parititions the one with shortest total travel cost is
    selected as the optimized solution. The method based on Floyd-Warshall
    algorithm like in from Beasley (1983) is used to find a shortest path of 
    "shortcuts" (i.e. VRP routes) through this giant tour.
    
    The algorithm expects following parameters:
    
    * D is a numpy ndarray (or equvalent) of the full 2D distance matrix.
    * d is a list of demands. d[0] should be 0.0 as it is the depot.
    * C is the capacity constraint limit for the identical vehicles.
    * L is the optional constraint for the maximum route length/cost/duration.
    * partitioning_method sets how partitions are made. I
       
    Furthermore, the algorithm can be exdended by using a different giant tour
    generation algorithm tsp_gen_algo and a cluster routing algorihm
    partition_opt_algo. Both have a signature of algo(D, node_idxs), where D is the 
    (full) distance matrix and node_idxs a list of node indices to route.
    Giving a random giant tour initialization with 2-opt improvement step as
    tsp_gen_algo and 3-opt improvement as tsp_opt_algo the results of 
    Beasley (1983) can be replicated.

    As in Beasley (1983), we do not include the depot when solving the TSP.
    Also, in this implementation relies on external solver solving the TSP,
    which is by default the estate-of-the-art LKH (Helsgaun 2006 & 2009).
