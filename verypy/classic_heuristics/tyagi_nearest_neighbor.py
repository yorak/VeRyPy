""" This file is a part of the VeRyPy classical vehicle routing problem
heuristic library and provides an implementation of the Tyagi (1968) nearest
neigbor heuristic. It extends the basic procedure in nearest_neighbor.py with
an intra route improvement scheme.

The script is callable and can be used as a standalone solver for TSPLIB
formatted CVRPs. It has moderate dependencies: a TSP solver (the built in local
search solver can be used), and numpy and scipy for reading and preparing the
problem instance.

    """ This is an implementation of the Tyagi (1968) nearest neighbor 
    heurstic. In the first phase the method distributes customers into groups
    using bulding a nearest neighbor chains leaving from the depot. The group
    is deemed complete when a constraint is violated. Then an interchange 
    heuristic tries to remove one node from the group so that the one left out 
    can be fitted. This interchange is done if the demand of the route 
    increases due to the swap. If a group with only one customer is generated, 
    all of the candidates that are close to the depot and have large demand are 
    considered to be served with a route with a single customer. Furthermore 
    the entire procedure is repeated for all single customer route candidates 
    and the one that has "maximum use of the capacity" is used (see option 
    select_grouping). Then a TSP procedure is used to route the customer
    groups. This this implementation uses 3-Opt local search to do the routing 
    instead of the greedy TSP heuristic described in Tyagi (1968).
    
    The procedure above is used when the function is called with parameters:
     * only_large_and_close_customer_single_routes = True,
     * try_interchange_with_all_group_customers = False,
     * select_grouping = "max_demand"
    The "max_demand" selects the grouping where the non-single routes carry
    most capacity.
      
    However, these settings do not greate the grouping nor solution presented
    as an illustrative example in Tyagi (1968). It seems he uses different
    undocumented variant of his heuristic to solve the 12 customer problem
    from Dantzig and Ramser (1958). Therefore, following changes and options 
    were added, and can be used, to replicate the result:
     * only_large_and_close_customer_single_routes = False, which allows any 
        customer be served with a single customer route. 
     * try_interchange_with_all_group_customers = True, which tries to do the
        interchange with all of the nodes in a group (proto-route), instead of
        trying just the first and last customers.
     * select_grouping = "balanced", which selects the most balanced
        alternative among the grouping candidates with single customer route.
        Here, only the non-single customer routes are considered.
    Alternatively, another option for selecting grouping (which more closely
    follows the idea of Tyagi) can be used:
     * select_grouping = "min_penalty", which selects the option where 
        the routes with lot of free capacity are shortest (individual edges 
        or the used vehicle capacity when traversing them are not considered).
        This is calculated on the optimized routes.
        
    Note that if C is not set the select_grouping and its functionality is not
     used.
    
    With these options the grouping of customers given in illustrative
    example is replicated and as is the solution quality. Unfortunately it 
    is impossible to say if the modifications are the ones Tyagi (1968) used.
