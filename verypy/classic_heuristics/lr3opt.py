""" This file is a part of the VeRyPy classical vehicle routing problem
heuristic library and provides an implementation of the Stewart & Golden (1984)
3-opt* heuristic with Lagrangean relaxation.

The script is callable and can be used as a standalone solver for TSPLIB 
formatted CVRPs. It has moderate dependencies: a TSP solver (the built-in one 
can be used) and the internal 3-opt* implementation. Also, numpy is needed for
by the algorithm for few convenience functions, as well as scipy for reading 
and preparing the problem instance.

    """ An implementation of the Stewart & Golden [1]_ 3-opt* heuristic
    with Lagrangean relaxation.
    
    The algorithm starts from a solution that can be either feasible or
    infeasible and uses local search to move towards better and feasible 
    solutions. More specifically, it works by replacing the constraint checks 
    of the 3-opt* with a penalty that depends on how much the constraint was 
    violated. The 3-opt* that operates on the entire solution, that is, checks 
    for both intra and inter route moves on one pass, was used. The penalties
    are iteratively doubled as the local search progresses and it is assumed
    that this eventually forces the solutions to feasible region.

           heuristic for vehicle routing. European Journal of Operational
           Research, 15(1):84â€“88.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    D : numpy.ndarray
        is the full 2D distance matrix.
    d : list
        is a list of demands. d[0] should be 0.0 as it is the depot.
    C : float
        is the capacity constraint limit for the identical vehicles.
    L : float
        is the optional constraint for the maximum route length/duration/cost.
    
    initial_lambda1_C : float
        is the initial Langrange multiplier value for the capacity constraint C.
        If left empty (None) the formula ``l1_C=average(d)/(20*max(D))`` is used.
        The alternative value suggested by Stewart & Golden (1984) was 0.05.
    initial_lambda1_L : float
        is the initial Langrange multiplier value for the maximum route cost/
        duration/length constraint. If left empty (None) the formula
        ``l1_L=average(distance to nearest neighbor)/(10*max(D))`` is used.
    initialization_algorithm (function): is a function that retuns a TSP or VRP 
        solution and its objective function value. The default is to use LKH TSP 
        solution, but the function _init_with_random can be used to replicate the
        results of Stewart & Golden (1984) where a random solution is used.
    
    Returns
    -------
    list
        The solution as a list of node indices to visit.
    
    .. todo:: due to how the algorithm works, introducing minimize_K would require
    balancing between penalizing constraint violations and penalizing new 
    routes with an additional multipiler. This was not implemented.
